This repo provides the code that follows the Scalable example for Arctic Fox. This code will demonstrate how Arctic Fox can rapidly adapt a design and scale it up or down. You simply need to change the value of //[$coreCount 4] in ScalableTop.v to increase or decrease the number of compute units. This example was put together to give a quick introduction to Arctic Fox.
